          <h3>Spinosaurus</h3>
          <p>
            The first Spinosaurus fossil was destroyed during World War II. The
            Spinosaurus is the largest meat-eating land animal ever discovered.
            He was 50 feet long and as tall as a 2-storey house. His skull alone
            was a whopping 6ft long, and he had a huge, distinctive sail fin on
            his back. He fed on a diet of fish and other dinosaurs. He roamed
            the floodplains of what is now North Africa, during the Late
            Cretaceous period.

          <h3>Giganotosaurus</h3>
          <p>
            Giganotosaurus is one of the largest predators known to have
            existed. The first Giganotosaurus fossil was of a leg bone &
            discovered in 1993. Giganotosaurus thin, razorlike teeth measured
            6inchs and its head was a gigantic 6.5 ft long, his body was 40ft
            long, and he weighed 8000kg or approx 125 people. It fed on other
            large dinosaurs and animals. Giganotosaurus roamed the plains of
            South America from the Early Cretaceous period.

          <h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>
          <p>
            Tyrannosaurus Rex is probably the most famous of all the dinosaurs.
            Its name means King of the Lizards. It was thought to be the largest
            carnivore until recent Spinosaurus fossil finds found that
            Spinosaurus grew to be a bigger size. T-rex had a massive 6ft long
            skull, with banana shaped teeth, 20cm long.Its bite was strong
            enough to crush a car. T-rex was 40ft in length,weighed twice as
            much as an elephant and had feathers. Despite its whopping size it
            had incredibly small arms. It fed on a diet of meat, hunting other
            dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus roamed the lands of North America during
            the Late Cretaceous period.

          <h3>Argentinosaurus</h3>
          <p>
            Argentinosaurus was a gigantic dinosaur. A complete skeleton of this
            dinosaur has not yet been discovered. Scientists estimate it would
            have weighed approx 100tons or the same as 6 fire engines. It had
            huge pillarlike legs to support its weight. It fed on plant matter
            and would have had to eat approx 230kg of leaves a day. It was 115ft
            in length, and is the largest land animal ever to walk the earth. It
            did not stop growing during its lifetime. Argentinosaurus would have
            roamed what is now Argentina during the Late Cretaceous.

            Mamenchisaurus had a very long neck and a tiny head. It fed on a
            diet of plants and leaves. Mamenchisaurus has the longest neck of
            any dinosaur at a giant 50ft long. They lived in family groups. It
            was a massive 85ft long. It roamed the plains of what is now China
            during the Late Jurassic period.

            Brachiosaurus is one of the most famous herbivore dinosaurs. It had
            a long neck and pillar like legs. Its front legs were longer than
            its hind legs. It was 80ft long and almost 50ft tall. Its fossils
            have been found in North America, Europe and Africa. It roamed the
            forests of the Late Jurassic period.
