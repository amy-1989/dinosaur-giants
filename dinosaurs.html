        <h3>Spinosaurus</h3>
        <p>
          The first Spinosaurus fossil was destroyed during World War II. The
          Spinosaurus is the largest meat-eating land animal ever discovered. He
          was 50 feet long and as tall as a 2-storey house. His skull alone was
          a whopping 6ft long, and he had a huge, distinctive sail fin on his
          back. He fed on a diet of fish and other dinosaurs. He roamed the
          floodplains of what is now North Africa, during the Late Cretaceous
          period.

        <h3>Giganotosaurus</h3>
        <p>
          Giganotosaurus is one of the largest predators known to have existed.
          The first Giganotosaurus fossil was of a leg bone & discovered in
          1993. Giganotosaurus thin, razorlike teeth measured 6inchs and its
          head was a gigantic 6.5 ft long, his body was 40ft long, and he
          weighed 8000kg or approx 125 people. It fed on other large dinosaurs
          and animals. Giganotosaurus roamed the plains of South America from
          the Early Cretaceous period.

        <h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>
        <p>
          Tyrannosaurus Rex is probably the most famous of all the dinosaurs.
          Its name means King of the Lizards. It was thought to be the largest
          carnivore until recent Spinosaurus fossil finds found that Spinosaurus
          grew to be a bigger size. T-rex had a massive 6ft long skull, with
          banana shaped teeth, 20cm long.Its bite was strong enough to crush a
          car. T-rex was 40ft in length,weighed twice as much as an elephant and
          had feathers. Despite its whopping size it had incredibly small arms.
          It fed on a diet of meat, hunting other dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus
          roamed the lands of North America during the Late Cretaceous period.

        <h3>Argentinosaurus</h3>
        <p>
          Argentinosaurus was a gigantic dinosaur. A complete skeleton of this
          dinosaur has not yet been discovered. Scientists estimate it would
          have weighed approx 100tons or the same as 6 fire engines. It had huge
          pillarlike legs to support its weight. It fed on plant matter and
          would have had to eat approx 230kg of leaves a day. It was 115ft in
          length, and is the largest land animal ever to walk the earth. It did
          not stop growing during its lifetime. Argentinosaurus would have
          roamed what is now Argentina during the Late Cretaceous.
