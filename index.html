        <p>
        Dinosaurs are ancient, prehistoric reptiles that lived during the
        Mesozoic Era.The first dinosaurs on earth appeared around 250 million years ago
        during the Triassic Period. Over millions of years, lots of new and
        exciting types of dinosaurs evolved. </p>
        <p>Some dinosaurs had long necks for grazing treetops, some
        had fearsome claws and sharp teeth for catching prey, some even had
        huge spikes and bony, armoured bodies for fending off predators. They
        had bony skeletons, leathery skin and, in some cases, even feathers.
        Some dinosaurs ate only leaves & ferns which we call
        <a href="#herbivores">herbivores</a>. Some dinosaurs were meat eaters
        and hunted other dinosaurs for dinner. These are called
        <a href="#carnivores">carnivores</a>. </p>
        <p>One of the most fascinating things about dinosaurs is how they evolved to become so huge.
        Scientists theorise that the dinosaurs ability to grow to such massive sizes was partly due to special air sacs in the bones of these dinosaurs which made them lighter, and partly due to an abundance of food among other things. No matter the reason, the dinosaurs evolved to become the largest creatures that ever lived. They thrived on earth for more than 185
        million years, until their <a href="#extinction">extinction</a> at the
        end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago.

        <div class="paragraph" id="middlep"><h3>How do we know about dinosaurs?</h3>
        <p>
          Scientists who study dinosaurs are called palaeontologists.
          Palaeontologists dig fossils to learn about life in prehistoric times.
          Fossils are the remains of animals or plants, or dinosaurs that died
          many thousands or millions of years ago. </p>
          <p>Fossils form when the
          dinosaur, for example, dies and its body falls into sand or mud. Over
          time more and more layers of sand and mud build up and eventually
          turns the bones to rock. By studying these bones scientists can tell
          all about how a dinosaur lived, how big it was and even what kind of
          food it ate.

        <div class="paragraph" id="extinction"><h3>What happened to the dinosaurs?</h3>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million years ago. At that time a
          huge asteroid crashed into the earth at Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
          The impact caused huge amounts of dust and ash to go up into the
          atmosphere and block out the suns light and heat. It caused the
          Earths' climate to change dramatically. </p>
          <p> During the same period there
          were lots of volcanic eruptions happening that were sending clouds of
          gas into the atmosphere which would have added to climate change.
          Nearly 90% of all species on earth, including all the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct at this
          time.
