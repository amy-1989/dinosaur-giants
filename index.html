        <p>
          The first dinosaurs on earth appeared around 250 million years ago
          during the Triassic Period. Over millions of years, lots of new and
          exciting types of dinosaurs evolved. From the tiny, Compsognathus
          which was no bigger than a chicken to huge giants such as
          <a href="argentinosaurus" #>Argentinosaurus</a>, which was as heavy as
          six fire engines. The dinosaurs thrived on earth for more than 185
          million years, until their <a href="#extinction">extinction</a> at the
          end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago.

        <h3>What are dinosaurs?</h3>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs are ancient, prehistoric reptiles that lived during the
          Mesozoic Era. Some dinosaurs had long necks for grazing treetops, some
          had fearsome claws and sharp teeth for catching prey, some even had
          huge spikes and bony, armoured bodies for fending off preators. They
          had bony skeletons, leathery skin and, in some cases, even feathers.
          Some dinosaurs ate only leaves & ferns which we call
          <a href="#herbivores">herbivores</a>. Some dinosaurs were meat eaters
          and hunted other dinosaurs for dinner. These are called
          <a href="#carnivores">carnivores</a>. The dinosaurs came in all shapes
          and sizes. Microraptor, for example was the size of a turkey, whereas
          <a>Spinosaurus</a> was taller than a two-storey house and longer than
          a double-decker bus. One of the most fascinating things about
          dinosaurs is how they managed to grow quite so big.

          plant-eating dinosaurs. <a href="#carnivores">Click here</a> to learn
          more about the largest meat-eating dinosaurs.

        <h3>How do we know about dinosaurs?</h3>
        <p>
          Scientists who study dinosaurs are called palaeontologists.
          Palaeontologists dig fossils to learn about life in prehistoric times.
          Fossils are the remains of animals or plants, or dinosaurs that died
          many thousands or millions of years ago. Fossils form when the
          dinosaur, for example, dies and its body falls into sand or mud. Over
          time more and more layers of sand and mud build up and eventually
          turns the bones to rock. By studying these bones scientists can tell
          all about how a dinosaur lived, how big it was and even what kind of
          food it ate.
        </p>
        <h3>What happened to the dinosaurs?</h3>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million years ago. At that time a
          huge asteroid crashed into the earth at Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
          The impact caused huge amounts of dust and ash to go uo into the
          atmosphere and block out the suns light and heat. It caused the
          planets climate to change dramatically. During the same period there
          were lots of volcanic eruptions happening that were sending clouds of
          gas into the atmosphere which would have added to climate change.
          Nearly 90% of all species including the dinosaurs went extinct at this
          time.
