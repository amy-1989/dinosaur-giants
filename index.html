            <p>
            Dinosaurs are ancient, prehistoric reptiles that lived during the
            Mesozoic Era.The first dinosaurs on earth appeared around 250 million years ago
            during the Triassic Period. Over millions of years, lots of new and
            exciting types of dinosaurs evolved. 
            </p>
            <p>Some dinosaurs had long necks for grazing treetops, some
            had fearsome claws and sharp teeth for catching prey, some even had
            huge spikes and bony, armoured bodies for fending off predators. They
            had bony skeletons, leathery skin and, in some cases, even feathers.
             Some dinosaurs ate only leaves & ferns which we call
            <a href="#herbivores">herbivores</a>. Some dinosaurs were meat eaters
            and hunted other dinosaurs for dinner. These are called
             <a href="#carnivores">carnivores</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>One of the most fascinating things about dinosaurs is how they evolved to become so huge.
            Scientists theorise that the dinosaurs ability to grow to such massive sizes was partly due to special air sacs in the bones of these dinosaurs which made them lighter, and partly due to an abundance of food among other things. No matter the reason, the dinosaurs evolved to become the largest creatures that ever lived. They thrived on earth for more than 185
            million years, until their <a href="#extinction">extinction</a> at the
            end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago.

            <h3>How do we know about dinosaurs?</h3>
            <p>
            Scientists who study dinosaurs are called palaeontologists.
            Palaeontologists dig fossils to learn about life in prehistoric times.
            Fossils are the remains of animals or plants, or dinosaurs that died
            many thousands or millions of years ago. </p>
            <p>Fossils form when the
            dinosaur, for example, dies and its body falls into sand or mud. Over
            time more and more layers of sand and mud build up and eventually
            turns the bones to rock. By studying these bones scientists can tell
            all about how a dinosaur lived, how big it was and even what kind of
            food it ate.

            <h3>What happened to the dinosaurs?</h3>
            <p>
            Dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million years ago. At that time a
            huge asteroid crashed into the earth at Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
            The impact caused huge amounts of dust and ash to go up into the
            atmosphere and block out the suns light and heat. It caused the
            Earths' climate to change dramatically. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            During the same period there were lots of volcanic eruptions happening that were sending clouds of
            gas into the atmosphere which would have added to climate change.
            Nearly 90% of all species on earth, including all the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct at this
            time.
